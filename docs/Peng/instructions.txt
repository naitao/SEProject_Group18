Since you are using a VPC, this is how it should be configured in order to accept connections from your sub-net only:

select VPC Security Group used by your db instance
add a new rule to allow all ips from your private sub-net on port 3306

ex: Rule INBOUND 3306 (MYSQL) 172.33.11.0/24
use mysql workbench tcp/ssh and it will work (follow AndrewSmiley answer).
